Welcome to this Python program using the Turtle library.
Usage

To use this program, you must first have Python and the Turtle library installed on your computer.

Once the program is running, you will be prompted to use the keyboard keys to control the turtle. The available commands are as follows:

    w : move forward
    s : move backward
    a : turn left
    d : turn right
    c : clear all traces and return to the starting point

Note

It is important to note that when you use the "c" key to clear all traces and return to the starting point, all previously entered commands will be cleared and the turtle will return to its original position.
Enjoy

Feel free to play with the commands and explore the possibilities of the Turtle library. Have fun!
