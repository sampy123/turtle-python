<h1>README.md</h1>

Welcome to this Python program using the colorgram and turtle libraries.

<h2>Description</h2>

This program uses the colorgram library to extract the main colors from an image file and then uses the turtle library to draw a grid of dots in those colors. The resulting image will be similar to a Damien Hirst dot painting.

<h2>Usage</h2>

To use this program, you must first have Python and the colorgram and turtle libraries installed on your computer. You also need to provide an image file named "colours.jpg" in the same folder as the code.

The program will extract the 30 main colors from the image and use them to draw a grid of dots. The number of dots, size and the dot's position can be adjusted by changing the parameters in the code.

You can also change the turtle's speed to make the drawing process faster or slower by changing the parameter in turtle.speed() function.
Note

This program is inspired by the artwork of Damien Hirst and is not an exact reproduction. The program uses randomness to generate the dots and colors, so the final result may differ from the original painting.

<h2>Enjoy</h2>

We hope you enjoy this program and have fun exploring the possibilities of the colorgram and turtle libraries.
