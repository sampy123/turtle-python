<h1>README.md</h1>

Welcome to this Python program using the turtle library.
<h2>Description</h2>

This program creates a race of six turtle with different colors and prompt the user to make a bet on which turtle will win the race. The race will start as soon as the user makes a bet. The user's bet will be compared to the turtle that reaches the end of the race first. If the user's bet matches the color of the turtle that wins the race, the user wins, otherwise the user loses.
<h2>Usage</h2>

To use this program, you must have python and the turtle library installed on your computer.

When you run the code, a window will be displayed asking the user to make a bet. The user should enter the color of the turtle they think will win the race. After the user makes a bet, the race will start automatically.

The race will end when one of the turtle reach the end of the race and the winner's color will be displayed. If the user's bet matches the winner's color, the user wins, otherwise the user loses.
<h2>Note</h2>

The turtle's speed and the distance they move each time are random, so the outcome of the race can be different each time the program is run.
Enjoy

We hope you enjoy this program and have fun exploring the possibilities of the turtle library and making bets!
